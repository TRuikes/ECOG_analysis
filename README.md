# Preparing recording for analysis

Prep the recording data directory for analysis

1. Each recording file should start with `rec_#_`, for each
recording there should be a `.json.xdat`, `_data.xdat`, 
`_timestamp.xdat` file per recording
2. Prepare a `stimulation_per_recording` table, see
the template in `/docs`
